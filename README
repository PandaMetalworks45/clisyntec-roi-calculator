# CLISYNTEC TCO Coolants & Lubricant Calculator

This professional ROI tool is designed by Consultant Lubricants to provide a data-driven comparison between your current stamping compounds and CLISYNTEC high-performance fluids.

##Beyond Price-Per-Gallon
Unlike basic calculators, this tool evaluates the physical and mechanical factors that impact the bottom line:
* **Physical Specs:** Viscosity, Metal Type, and Temperature stability.
* **Mechanical Impact:** Shut height adjustments and tooling friction.
* **Economic ROI:** Scrap reduction, tool life extension, and wash-zone energy savings.

## How to Use
1. **Input Production Data:** Enter your current parts per shift and metal type.
2. **Enter Physical Specs:** Compare the viscosity and temperature performance of your current fluid vs. CLISYNTEC.
3. **Review TCO:** View the "Total Cost of Ownership" rather than just the invoice price.
